# JavaScript coding guidelines

This is an extension to [Node Styleguide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) by Felix GeisendÃ¶rfer. Anything from this document overrides what could be said in the Node Styleguide.

**Always lint code before pushing.**

## EOF

Always add a trailing blank line at end of file.

## String interpolation

When a string contains a variable, use backticks rather than single quotes to wrap it.

```js
console.log(`Theme: #{value}.`);
```

## Module imports

```js
import { foo } from './foo';
```

## Module exports

Exported functions and classes should always have a name, even if it's not required per see. Naming exports help debugging and figuring out what's going on.

```js
export default function foo() {}
export default class Bar {}
```

## Object description

Objects with 1 or 2 key/value pairs can be written either on a single line or on multiple lines, with no extra comma.

```js
let obja = { foo: 'foo' };
let objb = { foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar' };

f({ foo: 'foo' });
f({ foo: 'foo', bar: 'bar' });
```

Objects with at least 3 key/value pairs should be written with each pair on its own line. Last pair also has a trailing comma to make it easier to move lines around.

```js
let obj = {
  foo: 'foo',
  bar: 'bar',
  baz: 'baz',
};

f({
  foo: 'foo',
  bar: 'bar',
  baz: 'baz',
});
```

## Variable declaration

Variable declarations, no matter with `var` or `let` should not be aligned.

```js
let a = 1;
let ba = 2;
```

## Arrow functions

```js
let x = () => {
  // ...
};
```

## Default arguments in functions

Equal symbol (`=`) should always be surrounded by spaces when defining default values for arguments in a function signature.

```js
function foo(bar = 'baz') {}
```

## Code blocks

Whenever writing an `if`/`else` statement, the `else` keyword should directly follow the closing curly brace from the `if` statement. No line break between the closing brace and the keyword should exist.

Also, there should always be a single space between the `if` keyword and the condition.

```js
if (condition) {
  // ...
} else if (condition) {
  // ...
} else {
  // ...
}
```

Same goes with do/while and try/catch.

## Inline documentation

Every function should be documented using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/). Annotations should not be aligned in order not to have to update alignment whever a longer line is added.

```js
/**
 * @param {String} foo
 * @return {Boolean}
 * @see something
 */
```

## Comments

All comments, both inline and multiline should be written in proper English, starting with a cap, ending with a full stop. Inline comments (`//`) are used when the comment holds on a single line (<80 characters). Multiline C-style comments (`/** */`) are used when the comment is splitted across several lines.

```js
// Post process configuration.
cfg.post(config);

config.view = config; // Backward compatibility.

/**
 * This is an extra long comment that does not fit on a single line because it
 * is longer than 80 characters. Because of this, it it splitted across several
 * lines.
 */
```
